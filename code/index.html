        <p>I have been writing little programs since we played around with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a>
            in fourth grade, and from the moment I picked up <em>K&amp;R C</em>, I've been working
            on a UNIX beard...  (This spring, I even found myself getting paid to hack in Lisp
            within <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html">Lucid Emacs</a>: that is
            a long story.)

            At the moment, however, this page is the home for a handful of new things: I've
            just read <em>The Little Schemer</em> and am toying with both Haskell and
            <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/crockford/">JavaScript</a>.  Enjoy!
        </p>

            <dd>Isn't the syntax highlighting pretty? I'm trying to learn some basics about Haskell's
                option and argument handling, so real programs that do things get easier to write!

            <dd>This is a tool for searching within Excel spreadsheets and then navigating
                to the cells with resulting matches: one thing I wish was better done by Excel 2003,
                at least.  I made this from an unholy combination of JavaScript, jQuery, and
                ActiveX (sorry, it does require IE and Microsoft Excel). 
                This one actually does something in only ~250 lines of JavaScript!</dd>
