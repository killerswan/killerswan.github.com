        <p>I have been writing little programs since we played around with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a>
            in fourth grade, and from the moment I picked up <em>K&amp;R C</em>, I've been working
            on a UNIX beard...  (This spring, I even found myself getting paid to hack in Lisp
            within <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html">Lucid Emacs</a>: that is
            a long story.)

            At the moment, however, this page is the home for a handful of new things: I've
            just read <em>The Little Schemer</em> and am toying with both Haskell and
            <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/crockford/">JavaScript</a>.  Enjoy!
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><a href="monkeyPrototypes.html">monkeyPrototypes</a></dt>
            <dd>Hijinks with JavaScript objects and prototypes, with examples in the primate family tree!
            </dd>

            <dt><a href="prettifyXHR.html">prettifyXHR</a></dt>
            <dd>I've created a script which provides a function which can use XMLHttpRequest 
                to retrieve a file, then inserts it into the document and applies syntax highlighting
                from prettify.  This shows it in action.

            <dt><a href="firstXHR.html">firstXHR</a></dt>
            <dd>This is a brief experiment with <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.
            </dd>

            <dd>I'm experimenting with the HTML5 FileReader and toying with Flot and jqPlot graphs...
            </dd>

            <dt><a href="orbital.html">orbital</a></dt>
            <dd>I'm experimenting with HTML5 geolocation.  I'm not saving your location, though.  Yet.
            </dd>

            <dt><a href="hsOpts.html">hsOpts</a></dt>
            <dd>Isn't the syntax highlighting pretty? I'm trying to learn some basics about Haskell's
                option and argument handling, so real programs that do things get easier to write!
            </dd>

            <dt><a href="excelGrep.html">excelGrep</a></dt>
            <dd>This is a tool for searching within Excel spreadsheets and then navigating
                to the cells with resulting matches: one thing I wish was better done by Excel 2003,
                at least.  I made this from an unholy combination of JavaScript, jQuery, and
                ActiveX (sorry, it does require IE and Microsoft Excel). 
                This one actually does something in only ~250 lines of JavaScript!</dd>

            <dt><a href="august/images-and-iframes.html">images and iframes</a></dt>
            <dd>This was a very simple test of some things... (Watch out for alert boxes!)</dd>

            <dt><a href="july/test.html">scope</a></dt>
            <dd>This is a rough first look at closures and scope in JavaScript.  Don't mind me...</dd>
