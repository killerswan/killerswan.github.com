<h1>Code</h1>

<p>I have been writing little programs since we played around with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a>
    in fourth grade, and from the moment I picked up <em>K&R C</em>, I've been working
    on a UNIX beard...  (This spring, I even found myself getting paid to hack in Lisp
    within <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html">Lucid Emacs</a>: that is
    a long story.)
    At the moment, however, this page is the home for a handful of new things: I'm
    reading <em>The Little Schemer</em> and toying with both Haskell and
    <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/crockford/">JavaScript</a>.  Enjoy!
</p>

    <dd>(in progress...) I'm trying to learn some basics about Haskell's option and argument
        handling, so real programs that do things get easier to write!

    <dd>(in progress...) I'm experimenting with the HTML5 file API and possibly with SVG 
        drawing...

    <dt><a href="excelGrep.html">excelGrep</a></dt>
    <dd>This is a tool for searching within Excel spreadsheets and then navigating
        to the cells with resulting matches: one thing I wish was better done by Excel 2003,
        at least.  I made this from an unholy combination of JavaScript, jQuery, and ActiveX (sorry, it does require IE and Microsoft Excel). 
        This one actually does something in only ~250 lines of JavaScript!</dd>

    <dt><a href="august/images-and-iframes.html">images and iframes</a></dt>
    <dd>This was a very simple test of some things... (Watch out for alert boxes!)</dd>

    <dt><a href="july/test.html">scope</a></dt>
    <dd>This is a rough first look at closures and scope in JavaScript.  Don't mind me...</dd>
