   <p>It has now been quite a while, but I was briefly very excited about Google's Wave project, 
     particularly the protocol itself and federated servers.</p>
  
 
  <p>I saw it as a possible solution to one of the most frustrating processes we regularly have experienced
    at work: rather than email back and forth copies of a Word document with tracked changes, it would
    be much nicer to collaboratively edit a single Wave message.</p>
  
  <p>If Google's open sourced federated version of server software, and other implementations took off, I saw 
    this as a spectacular way to, as Google suggested, replace some big uses of email.  We would be able to
  run our own, trustworthy servers, send encrypted messages to other servers, and manage these messages with
  collaborative editing and change tracking!</p>
  
  <p>Google's open source implementation, FedOne, lacked a persistent storage system or a pretty UI, it 
    allowed an interesting look at and testing of the protocol.  Wave servers negotiated XMPP connections,
    which could be authenticated with SSL/TLS and encrypted, and then exchanged XMPP messages carrying the
    Wave protocol itself.
  </p>

  <p>When I started playing with things, I wrote a <a href="./code/wave/howto.html">Wave HOWTO</a> and started talking to all the other people hacking around with Wave.
  
  In the process, I found and wrestled with interesting issues with, for example,  
  <a href='http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/issues/detail?id=49'>server-to-server negotiation</a> 
  (<a href='https://bitbucket.org/killerswan/wave-protocol-kshh/diff/src/org/waveprotocol/wave/examples/fedone/federation/xmpp/XmppDisco.java?diff2=f77326b8f09d&diff1=21e6c3db105f'>XmppDisco.java</a>, 
    <a href='./code/wave/wave-protocol-kshh-f77326b8f09d.diff'>patch</a>) 
  and 
  <a href='http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/issues/detail?id=58'>discovery</a>.
  
  </p>
  
    <p>Although Google's own implementation, "Google Wave", had a brief moment in the sun, and 
      third parties were being encouraged to develop compatible services (such as Novell Pulse), things 
      gradually slowed to a halt.
      
  I don't know what Google's official metrics for success or failure of the project were, but now it is 
    mostly history, relegated to an <a href='http://incubator.apache.org/wave/'>Apache incubator</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>I think Google, however, did two things wrong.  First, they did not negotiate the arrangements with Yahoo
    and Microsoft that would have been necessary (at the very least) to get Wave's protocol on a track 
    to replace email.  Second, they targeted it incorrectly: rather than talk extensively about uses like 
    the complicated collaborative document editing that they had designed it for and users like me saw such promise in,
    they made it look like an instant messaging platform.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>I do hope that someday, though, somebody makes the right tool to ease my document shuffling chaos...</p>
