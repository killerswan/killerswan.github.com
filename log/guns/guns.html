<p><em>Although I'm not fully up to speed on the latest terrible
gun-related story from America, I've been asked by a friend abroad
about the oft-repeated claim that "the more guns you have the safer you are".
</em>

<p><em>I think I hold a more nuanced (or perhaps *confused*) view
than many, so here are some thoughts.
</em>

<!--
<h2>(A) Columbine
</h2>
-->

<p>I knew a kid whose family had moved
to Denver shortly before the Columbine attack.

<p>The day after, he and three friends were walking to their
car in their high school parking lot and one of them
called out "shotgun!"  A police officer happened to overhear
them and four geeky honor-roll jewish kids were cuffed and taken
into police custody.

<p>If you'd ever lived west of the Mississippi River, you'd
know that this is what we say to claim the front passenger seat:
the seat with all the leg room.  We call it shotgun, because
back when John Wayne and other cowboys roamed the west,
committing genocide to impress the ladies and then running
cattle over the land of our subsistence farmer ancestors,
every stagecoach needed a driver to steer the horses, and
someone sitting next to him, armed to the teeth, to deter
thieves.

<!--
<h2>(B) The West
</h2>
-->

<p>Correction: one of my ancestors was one of those rat bastards
who abandoned his family to become an "indian fighter", and
on another side my ancestors spat on General Santa Ana's
grave because he was the incompetent dictator who let
those jerkwad Texans win that war.

<p>The grandson of the indian fighter, though, was my grandpa.
He became a real Engineer with two college degrees and
built massive dam construction projects on multiple
continents, but he was born in 1899, in a log cabin,
way out in the boonies in Montana.  Right around where
you can't afford the real-estate now because Robert Redford
tried to buy the whole neighborhood.  (For all I know,
his grandpa beat up mine in grade school.  But that movie,
<a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105265/'>A River Runs Through It</a>,
is near perfection.)

<p>They needed guns when he was a kid, because that was a
big part of how they ate, and how they stayed alive.
They lived just on the edge: my mom has seen big hollow tree that kept my
great-grandfather alive, once, when a cougar was
following him home...

<p>In spite of all the utility, though, one of my great uncles was shot and died, at twelve,
in a "hunting accident".
And my grandpa, himself, was handicapped because, in some argument, somebody
shot a gun off next to him inside the house: he was pretty much deaf while still a teenager.

<p>
He always kept a gun, though. My grandma fondly
remembered one of their first dates, getting ice cream
and then going out in the country and shooting at bottles
with a little pistol.

<h2>(C) Malcolm X looking out the window of his house
</h2>

<p>There are many ways to tell the history of America,
and a lot of folks who won't give it to you straight.  But
it needs saying: Malcolm X wasn't just doing it to look cool.
He was hardly the only one under threat, too.

<p>We have a long and rarely discussed history of race riots
here.  In Omaha, in the summer of 1919, for example,
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Race_Riot_of_1919'>white people rioted</a>. 
"Shots were fired as the mob pillaged hardware stores
in the business district and entered pawnshops, seeking firearms.
Police records showed that more than 1,000 revolvers and shotguns
were stolen that night. The mob shot at any policeman..."

<p>These angry racists burned down the courthouse with people trapped
inside, lynched the man they were after, and tried to hang the mayor,
too.  The Army (not the National Guard) was called in, and
machine guns were placed all over Omaha before peace could be restored.

<p>Reading what I have of our history, one must conclude that even after the Civil War,
our eventual reconciliation was hardly guaranteed
to be a peaceful thing.  To the extent that it was, indeed,
peaceful...

<p>The historian Mark S. Grimsley makes an interesting case, in the
<a href='http://www.carlisle.army.mil/AHEC/mediagallery/videogallery.cfm?id=32'>USAHEC Perspectives in Military History Lecture Series</a>
(<a href='http://kevincantu.org/3p/mirror/living/civil-rights-as-an-insurgency.wmv'>alt</a>)
the American civil rights movement can be viewed as an insurgency.
It was, he says, an insurgency against the brutally oppressive
(mostly southern) local governments, seeking to sway the federal
government and national politics to intervene on their behalf.

<p>He also notes that the movement's non-violence was not a unanimous plan.
The peaceful marchers of Martin Luther King's churches likely got better treatment than
they might have if there weren't people like the
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacons_for_Defense_and_Justice'>Deacons for Defense</a>
waiting in the wings.

<p>Incidentally, that group of black war veteran Second Amendment
enthusiasts got a lot of their ammunition from the National Rifle
Association.   After WWII, you know, surplus .30-06 ammunition
was so plentiful people could get it for free.

<p>
(Those big rifle rounds remain cheap as dirt, and I know engineers
my age who, just like my grandpa, ate lots better as kids because
hunting licenses for deer are cheap and venison is tasty.)

<!--
<h2>(D) "OF JUST WARS AND THE DANGER OF WINNING THEM"
</h2>
-->

<p>We all must hold that World War II, with those flamethrower tanks
with .30 caliber machine guns and all, began as a "just war".

<p>The USA's birth was also one of just fire.  A war whose rhetoric was
unequivocally righteous, so much so that it set Europe ablaze, too.
In spite of the smoldering mess left for our other ancestors to deal with here, and
Napoleon for Europeans, I cannot think of it
in other terms.

<p>Read, again, this call to revolution in terms of humanity,
and in atheist Thomas Jefferson's appeal to God, <a href='http://usconstitution.net/declar.html'>a challenge</a>
for any fool to bring higher authority:

<blockquote>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed, —
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their Safety and Happiness."
</blockquote>

<p>In World War II, however, we seemed to lose track of that business about “all men” “created equal”.  In winning, we 
<a href='http://kevincantu.org/3p/mirror/living/henein-prestigeofterror.html'>became monsters ourselves</a>.
The atom bombs weren’t even the worst air raids we did.

<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PicassoGuernica.jpg
'><img src='./archive/guns/PicassoGuernica.jpg'></a>

<p>Somehow, in the decades after all that, like some kind of miracle,
at the height of the cold war, the civil rights movement
managed to put its stamp on history, with love and the law instead of its own bullets.
Our era of lynching really did end.


<!--
<h2>(E) "A true revolution of values"
</h2>
-->

<p>It is tantalizing to think of how much more remains unfinished.
Grimsley suggests that maybe they [or we] were defeated, in some sense.
It is in those relatively northerly cities like Los Angeles and Detroit where vast
wastelands of people seem, sometimes, to be totally abandoned.
New York City, we hear now, has spent years stopping and groping everyone
who doesn't fit their profile of an investment banker.
Chicago, I've heard, scared Martin Luther King, and it now happens to be
one of the places with the most aggressive gun control...

<p>But I know that one of the ones taken early from us
by a high powered rifle was the most cogent advocate for peace
<!-- <a href='http://kevincantu.org/3p/mirror/living/mlk-war.html'> -->
<a href='http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet/riversidetranscript.html'>I've ever heard</a>:

<blockquote>"A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring
contrast of poverty and wealth with righteous indignation. It will
look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West
investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America,
only to take the profits out with no concern for the social
betterment of the countries, and say, "This is not just."
It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin
America and say, "This is not just." The Western arrogance
of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing
to learn from them is not just. A true revolution of values will
lay hands on the world order and say of war, "This way of settling
differences is not just." This business of burning human beings
with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows,
of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples
normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody
battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged,
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love."
</blockquote>



<p>So I question our choice of toys...
